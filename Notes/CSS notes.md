# CSS

## Margin and padding
- Margin: The margin property controls the space outside of an element. It determines the distance between elements and affects the spacing between the element and its container, or adjacent elements.
- Padding: The padding property controls the space inside of an element. It determines the distance between the content of the element and its borders. It does not affect the spacing between elements.

To summarize:
- Margin controls the space outside an element.
- Padding controls the space inside an element.
